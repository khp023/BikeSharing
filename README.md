# Bike Sharing Analysis for Citibikes NYC

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to utilize Tableau on public data published by the Citi Bike program in order to identify trends in the scope of New York City (particularly Manhattan). This data can then be used as a potential model to support a proposal to investors for bike-sharing programs elsewhere. 

## Results
There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

The completed Tableau worksheet can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/khanh.phan5781/viz/NYCCitiChallenge/NYCCitiBikes?publish=yes). A story including four panes was created with the data. 

Important highlights of the story include the following:

## Summary 

Overall, through the Tableau story, it is important to scope the fact that since most of the data is on Manhattan island with the general city geography, the popular starting and ending locations are relatively close, to which trips will be shorter. 

The focus demographic analysis for this study is gender, to which it is found there is no clear difference relative to population for checkout times or for trip initiation times. The key difference is seen in comparing usertypes vs genders, in which it is found that subscribers of this program are mostly male-identifying users. 

Additional visualizations that may be performed for further study include perhaps being able to map out specific trip routes. That data can then be extended to find gender differences in location or distance.
